> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers MySQL server configuration for DevOps development

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* What is the main role of a database
* What is a database replica
* What is the purpose of a database replica
* Why database backups need to be stored in different physical locations
* What operation should you regularly perform to make sure that your database backup strategy actually works
